## 📋 **Refactor → Alpha → Beta → RC → Release**

### **REFACTOR Phase** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Goal**: Decouple transport layer from RPC core

- [x] **Core API Design**
  - [x] Lock adapter SPI interface (strict & minimal):
    ```zig
    pub const RpcTransport = struct {
        connect: fn(*std.mem.Allocator, []const u8, *const TlsCfg) !Conn,
    };
    pub const Conn = struct {
        openStream: fn() !Stream,
        close: fn() void,
    };
    pub const Stream = struct {
        writeFrame: fn(kind: u8, bytes: []const u8) !void, // flags|len|payload
        readFrame:  fn(*std.mem.Allocator) !Frame,
        cancel:     fn() void, // QUIC: STOP_SENDING/RESET; H2: RST_STREAM
    };
    pub const Frame = struct { kind: u8, bytes: []u8 };
    ```
  - [x] Define standard error taxonomy: `error.Timeout`, `error.Canceled`, `error.Closed`, `error.ConnectionReset`, `error.Temporary`, `error.ResourceExhausted`, `error.Protocol`
  - [x] Core enforces deadlines/cancellations/backpressure, signals via status frames

- [x] **Core Library Extraction**
  - [x] Extract transport-agnostic RPC core to `src/core/`
  - [x] Remove QUIC/HTTP2 imports from core modules
  - [x] Keep: codecs, framing, interceptors, deadlines, service dispatch
  - [x] Move out: TLS, QUIC specifics, network I/O, auth verification

- [x] **Transport Adapter Architecture**
  - [x] Create `src/adapters/quic/` for QUIC transport adapter (QUIC-first approach)
  - [x] Implement QUIC adapter interface using existing zquic RC1
  - [x] Ensure QUIC adapter works with existing streaming APIs
  - [x] HTTP/2 adapter deferred to BETA/optional (Zig std has no h2 yet)

- [x] **Build System Refactor**
  - [x] Update `build.zig` to support modular compilation
  - [x] Core: only codec toggles (`-Dprotobuf`, `-Djson`, `-Dcodegen`)
  - [x] All OS/network flags live in zquic (and later h2 lib)
  - [x] Ensure core compiles without any transport dependencies

### **ALPHA-1** ✅ **COMPLETE**

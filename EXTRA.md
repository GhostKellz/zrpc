Build it as pluggable transports—then implement two first-class backends:

zrpc-quic (native QUIC over TLS 1.3) — fastest path for S2S and LAN/WAN where you control both ends.

zrpc-h3 (HTTP/3 on top of zquic’s H3) — for Internet/CDN/proxy friendliness and browser/WebTransport.

Use the same core RPC framing/codec and swap transports at runtime.

Wire mappings (concrete)
1) zrpc-quic (native)

Handshake: TLS 1.3 (zquic). ALPN "zr/1". Optionally mTLS with gvault-issued certs.

Per-RPC stream: first frame = HEADERS (method, deadline, metadata), then MESSAGE frames.

Framing: gRPC-style is fine (1-byte flags + 4-byte length) or your own varint len | payload.

Cancel: client sends CANCEL control frame → server STOP_SENDING; server errors → RESET_STREAM.

Auth: first HEADERS carries authorization: Bearer <gvault-token>; or rely on mTLS subject.

2) zrpc-h3 (HTTP/3)

Unary/streaming over H3 request:

:method POST

:path /zrpc/<service>/<method>

content-type: application/zrpc+zpb (your zproto), optional content-encoding: zstd

Streaming = multiple framed messages in both request/response bodies.

Cancel = send H3 RST_STREAM.

WebTransport session:

CONNECT to /zrpc (WT). Each RPC = a WT bidi stream; WT datagrams = zRPC datagrams.

Same framing as native for parity.

Deadlines/metadata: headers like x-zrpc-timeout-ms, x-zrpc-trace-id. Reuse QPACK dyn tables.

Discovery & negotiation

DNS HTTPS/SVCB record for your service: advertise alpn="zr/1,h3", and optionally port, echconfig.

Alt-Svc header (on H3) to point clients to preferred H3 endpoint.

Client policy:

Try native QUIC if ALPN zr/1 accepted.

Fallback to H3; if Sec-WebTransport advertised, prefer WT for streaming.

Transport trait (Zig sketch)
pub const RpcTransport = struct {
    connect: fn (alloc: *std.mem.Allocator, ep: []const u8, tls: *TlsConfig) !Conn,
};

pub const Conn = struct {
    openStream: fn () !Stream,
    close: fn () void,
};

pub const Stream = struct {
    writeFrame: fn (kind: u8, payload: []const u8) !void,
    readFrame: fn (alloc: *Allocator) !Frame,
    cancel: fn () void,
};


Implement this twice:

transport/quic.zig uses zquic streams & datagrams.

transport/http3.zig uses H3 request bodies (or WT streams).

The core RPC layer stays identical across both.

Headers & content types (H3)

content-type: application/zrpc+zpb (binary zproto)

content-encoding: zstd (optional)

x-zrpc-timeout-ms: 5000

authorization: Bearer <gvault-token>

x-zrpc-trace-id: <uuid>

Paths: /zrpc/<service>/<method> or /zrpc/v1/<ns>/<svc>/<method>.

Security

TLS 1.3 everywhere (QUIC/H3 handled by zquic).

mTLS for S2S (gvault issues client certs); Bearer caps for user actions.

Capability claims embedded in token (method allowlist, resource scope, size/time budgets).

Flow control & backpressure

Let QUIC/H3 handle transport-level FC.

Add per-RPC message budgets in zRPC core (max inflight bytes/messages).

On backpressure, PAUSE reads, propagate RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED to client with retry hints.

Observability

Emit spans on stream open/close, frame read/write, retry, deadline hit.

zrpc-h3: log :path, 4xx/5xx, QPACK stalls; zrpc-quic: PTOs, stream resets, datagram loss.

Wire to zlog (json), expose /metrics and trace IDs for correlation.

Testing matrix (GhostSpec)

Transport parity tests: same request/response via quic vs h3 must match byte-for-byte payload.

Loss/latency property tests: inject reorder/drop; assert no deadlocks; deadline respected.

Cancel semantics: client cancel at Nth message → server cleanup.

Example: dual-listener server
pub fn main() !void {
    // Native QUIC
    var quic_srv = try zquic.listen(.{ .alpn = "zr/1", .addr = "0.0.0.0:8443", .tls = tlsCfg() });
    spawn acceptQuic(quic_srv, zrpcCoreHandler);

    // HTTP/3
    var h3_srv = try zquic.h3.listen(.{ .addr = "0.0.0.0:443", .tls = tlsCfg() });
    spawn serveH3(h3_srv, zrpcHttpHandler, webTransportHandler);

    await forever;
}


Client picks transport based on policy/discovery; same service impl handles both.

Practical defaults

ALPNs: "zr/1" (native), "h3" (HTTP/3). Consider "wt" tag internally for WebTransport session path.

Framing: gRPC-style (flags+len) buys you interop with tooling and simple streaming.

Compression: Zstd at message level, dictionary per service if payloads are similar.

Auth: gvault Bearer for users, mTLS for service accounts.

Timeouts: default 5s unary, 30s server-stream; heartbeat ping every 10s over control stream (datagram ok).

Bottom line

Build zRPC core once, define a clean RpcTransport interface.

Implement native QUIC and HTTP/3 (incl. WebTransport) over zquic.

Route by policy/discovery; keep codecs, auth, and semantics identical.
